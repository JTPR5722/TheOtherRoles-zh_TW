**Hotfix 1.8.2**
- Add map and Impostor count to lobby settings.
- Fixed bugs where changing players to be the Sidekick didn't reset all the effects of their previous role.

**Hotfix 1.8.1** Resolves bugs that occured when the Jackal recruited a Medic, Swapper and Tracker\
\
**Changes in v1.8:**
- **New Roles:** Added the Jackal and Sidekick roles

- Lover: New option that sets how often an ImpLover appears. If a Lover is exiled, his partner doesn't spawn a dead body anymore.
- Cooldowns now stop cooling down, if a player sits inside a vent.

\
**Changes in v1.6:**

- The Mini can't be voted out anymore before it turns 18, hence games can't end anymore because the Mini died.
- Footprints are no longer visible to the Detective, if players are inside vents.

\
**Changes in v1.5:**
- Time Master - Buff: He is not affected by his rewind anymore, which gives him more utility. Players will now be rewinded out of vents.
- Mini - Nerf: The Mini now grows up (see [Mini](#迷你)) and becomes a normal Crewmate at some point. A growing Mini is not killable anymore. Some tasks are still not doable for the small Mini, we are working on that. But eventually when growing up it can do all the tasks as it's size increases.
- Seer - Nerf: Added an option that sets how often the Seer mistakes the player for another.
- Hacker - Nerf: The Hacker now only sees the additional information when he activates his "Hacker mode". That should stops the Hacker from camping the admin table/vitals.
- Other: Camouflager/Morphling cooldowns were fixed. Custom regions code was removed to enable 3rd party tools. Some minor bugfixes.

**Changes in v1.4:**
- Fixing a Camoflager/Morphling animation bug
- Fixing a bug where the Swapper could swap votes even if they are dead
- The custom cooldown buttons now render the cooldown progress (the grey overlay) in the right way (v1.3 introduced the bug)

- Adds support for the Among Us version **2021.3.5s**
- Fixes a bug where a an edge case caused all players to start the game with the camouflaged look
- There might be a few bugs, since I focused on getting the update out fast. A new version resolving the bugs will be published tomorrow.

- Morphling: The color of pet now also morphs. The skin animation now starts at the right point.
- The game over screen now shows if the Jester/Mini/Lovers won.
- A bug was removed where the Jester won together with the Crewmates.
- A bug was removed where the game of the Lovers crashed if they were the last players killed by the host of the lobby.

4. Launch the game via Steam

# Custom Servers and 10+ Players
We always recommend you to play on custom servers rather than on the official ones. If you want to play with more than 10 players in one lobby, you're required to use a custom server. Credits for the original implementation that allowed 10+ player lobbies go to the creaters of the [CrowdedMod](https://github.com/CrowdedMods/CrowdedMod).

**Setup the Clients:**
1. Open the region menu where you can choose between the different regions
2. Select the region *Custom*
3. Enter the ip/domain and the port of your custom server in the corresponding text fields

**Setup the Server:**
1. Get the [Impostor](https://github.com/Impostor/Impostor) release for the Among Us version **2021.3.31 - 2021.4.2**
2. Follow the steps (using the server release you just downloaded) on the official [Impostor-Documentation](https://github.com/Impostor/Impostor/wiki/Running-the-server)
3. Make sure to set the following values to false in the `config.json` file:
```
    ...
    "AntiCheat": {
      "Enabled": false,
      "BanIpFromGame": false
    }
```
4. Make sure to forward the right ports on the hosting machine
5. Run the server and setup the client

**Setting up Server as Docker Container:** \
If you want to run the server as a docker container you'll need to use the image
```
aeonlucid/impostor:nightly
```
(Currently only the "nightly" tag is starting a server supporting 2021.3.31 or later)

In addition to running it, the environment variables to disable the AntiCheat feature need to be set.

# 設定
The mod adds a few new settings to Among Us (in addition to the role settings):
- **Streamer Mode:** You can activate the streamer mode in the Among Us settings. It hides the lobby code, the custom server ip and the custom server port. You can set a custom lobby code replacement text, by changing the *Streamer Mode Replacement Text* in the `BepInEx\config\me.eisbison.theotherroles.cfg` file.
- **Number of Impostors:** The number of Impostor count be set inside a lobby
- **Map:** The map can be changed inside a lobby
- **Maximum Number Of Meetings:** You can set the maximum number of meetings that can be called in total (every player still has personal maximum of buttons, but if the maximum number of meetings is reached you can't use your meetings even if you have some left, Impostor and Jackal meetings also count)
- **Allow Skips On Emergency Meetings:** If set to false, there will not be a skip button in emergency meetings. If a player does not vote, he'll vote himself.
- **Hide Player Names:** Hides the names of all players that have role which is unknown to you. Team Lovers/Impostors/Jackal still see the names of their teammates. Impostors can alse see the name of the Spy and everyone can still see the age of the mini.
- **Ghosts Can See Roles**
- **Ghosts Can See Votes**
- **Ghosts Can See The Number Of Remaining Tasks**
- **Dleks:** You are now able to select the Dleks map.
- **Task Counts:** You are now able to select more tasks.
- **Role Summary:** When a game ends there will be a list of all players and their roles and their task progress

### 地圖任務數上限
You can configure:
- 最多 4 個普通任務
- 最多 23 個短任務
- 最多 15 個長任務

Please note, that if the configured option exceeds the available number of tasks of a map, the tasks will be limited to that number of tasks. \
Example: If you configure 4 common tasks on Airship crewmates will only receive 2 common tasks, as airship doesn't offer more than 2 common tasks.

| 地圖 | 普通任務 | 短任務 | 長任務 |
|----------|:-------------:|:-------------:|:-------------:|
| Skeld / Dleks | 2 | 19 | 8
| Mira HQ | 2 | 13 | 11

# 自定義帽子
## Create and submit new hat designs
We're awaiting your creative hat designs and we'll integrate all the good ones in our mod.
Here are a few instructions, on how to create a custom hat:

- **Creation:** A hat consists of up to three textures. The aspect ratio of the textures has to be `4:5`, we recommend `300px:375px`:
    - `Main texture (required)`:
        - This is the main texture of your hat. It will usually be rendered in front of the player, if you set the `behind` parameter it will be rendered behind the player.
        - The name of the texture needs to follow the pattern *hatname.png*, but you can also set some additional parameters in the file name by adding `_parametername` to the file name (before the *.png*).
        - Parameter `bounce`: This parameter determines whether the hat will bounce while you're walking or not.
        - Parameter `adaptive`: If this parameter is set, the Among Us coloring shader will be applied (the shader that replaces some colors with the colors that your character is wearing in the game). The color red (#ff0000) will be replaced with the primary color of your player and the color blue (#0000ff) with the secondary color. Also other colors will be affected and changed, you can have a look at the texture of the [Crewmate Hat](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/among-us-wiki/images/e/e0/Crewmate_hat.png) to see how this feature should be used.
        - Parameter `behind`: If this parameter is set, the main texture will be rendered behind the player.
    - `Flipped texture (optional)`:
        - This texture will be rendered instead of the Main texture, when facing the left.
        - The name of the texture needs to follow the pattern `hatname_flip.png`.
    - `Back texture (optional)`:
        - This texture will be rendered behind the player.
        - The name of the texture needs to follow the pattern `hatname_back.png`.
    - `Flipped Back texture (optional)`:
        - This texture will be rendered instead of the Back texture, when facing the left.
        - The name of the texture needs to follow the pattern `hatname_back_flip.png`.
    - `Climb texture (optional)`:
        - This texture will be rendered in front of the player, when he's climbing.
        - The name of the texture needs to follow the pattern `hatname_climb.png`.
- **Testing:** You can test your hat design by putting all the files in the `\TheOtherHats\Test` subfolder of your mod folder. Then whenever you start a freeplay game, you and all the dummies will be wearing the new hat. You don't need to restart Among Us if you change the hat files, just exit and reenter the freeplay mode.

- **Submission:** If you got a hat design, you can submit it on our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/77RkMJHWsM). We'll look at all the hats and add all the good ones to the game.

# 職業

## 職業分配
We are still improving the role assignment system. It's not that intuitive right now, but it's more flexible than the older one
if you're using it right.

First you need to choose how many special roles of each kind (偽裝者/Neutral/Crewmate) you want in the game.
The count you set will only be reached, if there are enough Crewmates/偽裝者s in the game and if enough roles are set to be in the game (i.e. they are set to > 0%). The roles are then being distributed as follows:
- First all roles that are set to 100% are being assigned to arbitrary players
- After that each role that has 10%-90% selected adds 1-9 tickets to a ticket pool (there exists a ticket pool for Crewmates, Neutrals and 偽裝者s). Then the roles will be selected randomly from the pools as long it's possible (until the selected number is reached, until there are no more Crewmates/偽裝者s or until there are no more tickets). If a role is selected from the pool, obviously all the tickets of that role are being removed.
- The 黑手黨, 戀人 and 迷你 are being selected independently (without using the ticket system) according to the spawn chance you selected. After that the Crewmate, Neutral and 偽裝者 roles are selected and assigned in a random order.

**Example:**\
Settings: 2 special Crewmate roles, Snitch: 100%, Hacker: 10%, Tracker: 30%\
Result: Snitch is assigned, then one role out of the pool [Hacker, Tracker, Tracker, Tracker] is being selected\
Note: Changing the settings to Hacker: 20%, Tracker: 60% would statistically result in the same outcome .

## 抹除者
### **隊伍:偽裝者**
The Eraser is an 偽裝者 that can erase the role of every player.\
The targeted players will lose their role after the meeting right before a player is exiled.\
After every erase, the cooldown increases by 10 seconds.\
The erase will be performed, even if the Eraser or his target die before the next meeting.\
By default the Eraser can erase everyone but the Spy and other 偽裝者s. Depending on the options
he can also erase them (偽裝者s will lose their special 偽裝者 ability).
\
**NOTE:**
- The Shifter shift will always be triggered before the Erase (hence either the new role of the Shifter will be erased or the Shifter saves the role of his target, depending on who the Eraser erased)
- Erasing a Lover automatically erases the other Lover as well (if the second Lover is an ImpLover, he will turn into an 偽裝者)
- Erasing a Jackal that has a Sidekick, triggers the Sidekick promotion if it's activated in the settings
- As the erasing is being triggered before the eject of a player, erasing and voting out a Lover in the same round, would result in the
  ex Lover surviving as the partnership was erased before. Also a Jester win would not happen, as the erase will be triggered before.

您可以設定一個情人成為偽裝者的機率。\
戀人不知道他們伴侶的職業，只知道伴侶是誰。\
如果在遊戲結束時他們都還活著，則戀人獲勝。他們也可以用他們原來的團隊獲勝(例如，一個死得去的偽裝者可以用偽裝者獲勝，縱火狂戀人仍可以贏縱火狂的勝利）\
如果其中一個戀人是殺手(即豺狼/跟班/偽裝者)，他們可以實現只有戀人獲勝的"戀人獨贏"。\
如果情人中沒有殺手(例如縱火狂戀人+船員戀人)，並且遊戲結束時他們都還活著，則他們與船員一起獲勝。\
如果遊戲中有一個團隊偽裝者/豺狼戀人，只要他還活著，就不會計算船員情人的任務(任務勝利)。如果情人死了，他的任務才會被計算在內。\
\
**NOTE:**
- 在 2 船員 vs 2 偽裝者(或豺狼團隊的 2 名成員)和戀人不在同一個團隊中，遊戲不會自動結束，因為戀人仍然可以取得單人勝利。例如:如果還剩下以下角色 偽裝者+偽裝者戀人+戀人+船員，則遊戲不會結束，下一個殺人將決定偽裝者或戀人勝利。

## 轉職者
### **隊伍:船員**
The Shifter can take over the role of another Crewmate, the other player will transform into a Crewmate.\
The Shift will always be performed at the end of the next meeting right before a player is exiled. The target needs to be chosen during the round.\
Even if the Shifter or the target dies before the meeting, the Shift will still be performed.\
Swapping roles with an 偽裝者 or Neutral fails and the Shifter commits suicide after the next meeting (there won't be any body).\
The Shifter aims to save roles from leaving the game, by e.g. taking over a Sheriff or Medic that is known to the 偽裝者s.\
This works especially well against the Eraser, but also gives the Eraser the possiblity to act like a Shifter.\
The **special interactions** with the Shifter are noted in the chapters of the respective roles.\
\
**NOTE:**
- The Shifter shift will always be triggered before the Erase (hence either the new role of the Shifter will be erased or the Shifter saves the role of his target, depending on who the Eraser erased)
- If the Shifter takes over a role, their new cooldowns will start at the maximum cooldown of the ability
- One time use abilities (e.g. shielding a player or Engineer sabotage fix) can only used by one player in the game (i.e. the Shifter
  can only use them, if the previous player did not used them before)

## 時間管理大師
### **隊伍:船員**
The Time Master has a time shield which he can activate. The time shield remains active for a configurable amount of time.\
If a player trys to kill the Time Master while the time shield is active, the kill won't happen and the
time will rewind for a set amount of time.\
The kill cooldown of the killer won't be reset, so the Time Master
has to make sure that the game won't result in the same situation.\
The Time Master won't be affected by the rewind.\
\
**NOTE:**
- Only the movement is affected by the rewind
- A Vampire bite will trigger the rewind. If the Time Master misses shielding the bite, he can still shield the kill which happens a few seconds later.
- If the Time Master was bitten and has his shield active before when a meeting is called, he survives but the time won't be rewinded.
- If the Time Master has a Medic shield, he won't rewind.
- The shield itself ends immediately when triggered. So the timemaster can be attacked again as soon as the rewind ends.

## 豺狼
### **隊伍:豺狼**
The Jackal is part of an extra team, that tries to eliminate all the other players.\
The Jackal has no tasks and can kill 偽裝者s, Crewmates and Neutrals.\
The Jackal (if allowed by the options) can select another player to be his Sidekick.
Creating a Sidekick removes all tasks of the Sidekick and adds him to the team Jackal. The Sidekick loses his current role (except if he's a Lover, then he plays in two teams).
The "Create Sidekick Action" may only be used once per Jackal or once per game (depending on the options).
The Jackal can also promote 偽裝者s to be his Sidekick, but depending on the options the 偽裝者 will either really turn into the Sidekick and leave the team 偽裝者s or he will just look like the Sidekick to the Jackal an remain as he was.\
\
The team Jackal enables multiple new outcomes of the game, listing some examples here:
- The 偽裝者s could be eliminated and then the crew plays against the team Jackal.
- The Crew could be eliminated, then the Team Jackal fight against the 偽裝者s (the Crew can still make a task win in this scenario)

The priority of the win conditions is the following:
1. Crewmate 迷你 lose by vote
2. Jester wins by vote
3. Arsonist win
4. Team 偽裝者 wins by sabotage
5. Team Crew wins by tasks (also possible if the whole Crew is dead)
6. 戀人 among the last three players win
7. Team Jackal wins by outnumbering (When the team Jackal contains an equal or greater amount of players than the Crew and there are 0 偽裝者s left and team Jackal contains no Lover)
8. Team 偽裝者 wins by outnumbering (When the team 偽裝者s contains an equal or greater amount of players than the Crew and there are 0 players of the team Jackal left and team 偽裝者s contains no Lover)
9. Team Crew wins by outnumbering (When there is no player of the team Jackal and the team Impostrs left)

**NOTE:**
- The Jackal (and his Sidekick) may be killed by a Sheriff.
- A Jackal cannot target the 迷你, while it's growing up. After that he can kill it or select it as its Sidekick
- The Crew can still win, even if all of their members are dead, if they finish their tasks fast enough (that's why converting the last Crewmate with tasks left into a Sidekick results in a task win for the crew)

If both 偽裝者s and Jackals are in the game the game continues even if all Crewmates are dead. Crewmates may still win in this case by completing their tasks. Jackal and 偽裝者 have to kill each other.

\
**NOTE:**

## 間諜
### **隊伍:船員**
The Spy is a Crewmate, which has no special abilities.\
The Spy looks like an additional 偽裝者 to the 偽裝者s, they can't tell the difference.\
There are two possibilities (depending on the set options):
- The 偽裝者s can't kill the Spy (because otherwise their kill button would reveal, who the Spy is)
- The 偽裝者s can kill the Spy but they can also kill their 偽裝者 partner (if they mistake another 偽裝者 for the Spy)
  You can set whether the Sheriff can kill the Spy or not (in order to keep the lie alive).

## 守衛
### **隊伍:船員**
The Security Guard is a Crewmate that has a certain amount of screws that he can use for either sealing vents or for placing new cameras.\

The new camera will be visible after the next meeting and accessible by everyone.\
The vents will be sealed after the next meeting, players can't enter or exit sealed vents, but they can still "move to them" underground.\
**NOTE:**
- Tickster boxes can't be sealed
- The Security Guard can't place Cameras on MiraHQ
- The remaining number of screws can be seen above his special button
- On Skeld the four cameras will be replaced every 3 seconds (with the next four cameras). You can also navigate manually using the arrow keys.
